This is a personal project inspired by two friends, Goof and Myth, and their
tabletop tickling game. Definitely still a work in progress, no idea when it
will ever be finished. Who knows?

TODO:
* Actually implement locations and let the player start traversing the town
* Make the UI prettier
* Add class specific magic items
* Potentially combine abilities and effects as they are both essentially
  things to keep track of in between turns
* Make a version of this but as a Discord Bot (not a priority)
* A ton of other stuff I'm not remembering yet
